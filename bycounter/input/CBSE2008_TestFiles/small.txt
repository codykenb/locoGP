Der Tanz ist die erste Kunst, nicht bloß auf der Erde, sondern überhaupt auf der Welt. Ist es doch als wenn dem ganzen Universum bei der Schöpfung auf einem Oberonshorn wäre geblasen worden, so daß es sich drehen muß in ewigen Kreisen. Alle Planeten umtanzen ihre Sonne, und die Sonne selbst, der wegen ihrer Korpulenz zu viel Bewegung nicht zuzumuten ist, dreht sich um sich selbst, von der allgemeinen Tanzluft hingerissen. Was unsre eigne Erde betrifft, so hat die Art Zweitritt, die sie mit dem Monde macht, ohnstreitig die erste Veranlassung zur Erfindung des Walzers gegeben, den man daher mit vollem Rechte einen himmlischen Tanz nennen kann. An diese großen Beispiele halte man sich und lasse Moralisten und Ärzte schwatzen, welche den Tanz verdammen, erstre, weil sie guter Sittenregeln sich gewöhnlich zwar im Kopfe, desto schlechterer aber meist in den verdorrten Fußen bewußt sind, letztre, weil sie nur zu wohl einsehen, daß der Tanz das einzige Mittel ist, uns, indem wir den Winken der Natur folgen, gesund an Leib und Seele zu erhalten, und sie daher durch denselben um ihr ganzes Verdienst kommen würden. Denn lehrt ihnen nicht ihre Anatomie, wie unser ganzer Fuß durchaus zu nichts weiter als zum Tanzen eingerichtet ist, wie ein Muskel daran für das pas glissé, ein andrer für das pas floré gebaut erscheint u. f. f., wonach es jedenfalls eben so viel Arten Pas als Beinmuskeln geben muß; wie der Mensch bloß darum Zehenspitzen und ein Gelenk am Fuße hat, damit er auf den Spitzen sich heben und den Fuß gebührend strecken könne; wie ihm auch polstrige Wadenmuskeln, oder wenigstens Stellen, künstliche daran anzubringen, mitgegeben sind, um sich durch das Zusammenschlagen derselben beim Entrechat nicht wehe zu tun, und wie in alle jene Muskeln Nerven laufen, blos damit Sie, sowie ein Geigenstrich ertönt, in die zum Tanzen gehörigen Convulsionen geraten können. Der Arzt weiß es, daß er bei einem Tanzenden nichts zu suchen hat, der ein Glas Punsch oder Limonade auf einmal hinunterzustürzen der Flasche "Alle zwei Stunden ein Eßlöffel" vorzieht; darum geht er in die Stuben, wo Leute matt umherschleichen oder träg im Bette liegen: an diesen rächt sich die Natur für die Vernachlässigung ihres Willens; warum tanzen die Narren nicht? dann wären sie sicher nicht krank oder tot. Es gibt doch gewiß auf der Welt keine bessere Motion, als einen recht raschen Walzer nach einer gut gestrichenen Geige. Wer sonst gegen diesen Tanz eingenommen ist, braucht sich nur vorzustellen, wenn er einem Balle mit zusieht, die Leute daraus, die sich die Woche hindurch krank gesessen, trieben sich bloß des Schwitzens und um den Säfteumlauf zu befördern, im Kreise herum, weshalb auch Mancher noch mit Armen und Füßen dabei rechts und links nach Vermögen ausschlägt; und er muß die Sache ganz zweckmäßig finden.

Ich für mein Teil wollte lieber ein hölzerner Kreisel sein, den der Knabe mit der Peitsche, wie uns der Musikant mit dem Fiedelbogen zum Tanzen antreibt, als ein grundgelehrter Mann, dessen Beine nichts andres leisten als daß der Stuhl, auf dem er sitzt, statt vier, sechs hölzerne Füße hat. Nur darum ist ja die Kugel die vollkommenste Gestalt, weil sie unendlich viel Beine zum Tanzen hat, ja rundum bloß aus solchen besteht; denn jeder Punkt an ihr ist eine Zehenspitze, auf der sie sich drehen kann und wirklich dreht bei der leisesten Anregung. Wir unvollkommne Wesen haben nur erst zwei Punkte mit dieser Gestalt, die ein alter Weiser die göttliche nannte, gemein, mittelst deren wir die kreisförmigen himmlischen Bahnen nachahmen sollen; aber diese beiden Organe sind auch die edelsten unsers ganzen Körpers ; wie zwei Konsuln einst die ganze Last des Staats, so haben sie die ganze Last unsers Organismus zu tragen, zu lenken und zu regieren, der ihrer Willkür unbedingt gehorchen muß; denn wohin die Beine gehen, muß der ganze Mensch gehen. Und wie an einer Nadel der plumpe Knopf bloß wegen der Spitze vorhanden ist, so hat auch am Menschen der Kopf nur in Bezug auf seine Füße Wert, indem er durch seine Schwere hindert, daß sie von der Erde, die sie doch zum Stützpunkt beim Tanze brauchen, fortfliegen.

Um den Vorzug, den die Tanzkunst vor allen andern Künsten hat, einleuchtend zu erkennen, braucht man sie bloß etwas näher dagegen zu halten.

Wer bleibt vor einem schönen Gemälde länger als 5 Minuten stehen, dann spricht er: "wunderschön!" und geht weiter; wer aber geht willig vom Ball, ehe nicht das Morgenrot das Abendrot abgelöst hat, und welche Dame tut es nicht mit dem glücklichen Gefühl, dabei selbst der Gegenstand der Bewunderung gewesen zu sein, wozu gehört, daß sie sich oft herumdreht und herumdrehen läßt, um immer neue Ansichten darzubieten; und nur solche bleiben sitzen, bei denen man schon mit einer Ansicht mehr als genug hat.

Nie hat sich der Tanz dazu herabgelassen, der Musik zum Accompagnement zu dienen, denn wo sähe man zu einem Konzerte tanzen; wogegen allwärts die Musik dem Tanze zum Accompagnement dient; und warum haben sich so große Harmoniekünstler bilden müssen, als damit sie Opern schreiben, aus denen sich Wiener und Hopser machen lassen; kann man es doch als Kriterium einer guten Musik ansehen, daß sie hiezu tauglich ist. Und wer von den schönen Herren besucht in L. aus einer andern Ursache das Konzert, als um sich zum nächsten Balle zu engagieren, und wie oft zieht er nachher die Uhr heraus, ob nicht die Pause bald kommt, wo er sich mit Tee und Eis von der Langeweile erquicken kann.

Wer aber hat je während des raschen Walzers seine Hand hinter der schlanken Taille weggezogen um nach der Uhr zu sehen oder die Hand gähnend vor den Mund zu halten? Und wer von denen, die nur die Füße auf dem rechten Flecke haben, wählte wohl lange, wenn dort eine Beethoven'sche Symphonie gespielt wird und hier ein Vysilanti, ob er dort in Harmonieen sich wiegen oder hier die Füße zierlich schlenkern soll? Wer schwitzte nicht willig, daß ihm der Schweiß zu allen Poren herausdringt, als wäre er ein Faß der Danaiden, und feucht und stöhnt und zerarbeitet sich und läßt sich's unendlich sauer werden, daß der Zuschauer, der keine Ahnung von der Kunst hätte, inniges Mitleid mit ihm fühlen müßte; und das alles tut er, ohne bezahlt zu werden; er läßt sich die Kleider voll Staub dabei werden, den Frack mit Wachs beträufeln; zerkratzt sich die Schuhe am Boden, macht einen ganzen Waschanzug auf einmal schwarz, spuckt, wenn der Schweiß nicht mehr zureicht, Blut aus Nase und Mund, hat nichts, gar nichts davon; nur also der hohe innere Wert des Tanzes kann Ursach sein, daß er sich allem diesem Ungemach so willig unterzieht. Mit Recht läßt sich aber auch in der Tat der Tanz als ein Aufflug nach dem Himmlischen, Göttlichen betrachten, als ein Streben zur Engelsnatur: wir glauben Flügel zu haben, wollen uns in die Höhe Schwingen; aber es wird nur ein Hopsen, weil uns die Last unsers irdischen Körpers wieder zurückdrückt. Doch wir lassen es nicht an einem Versuche bewenden, und erst wenn wir matt sind vom vergeblichen Mühen, lassen wir ab, und mancher fand seinen Himmel schon in dem Aufstreben nach demselben.

Insoweit sich von einem Reize der Musik auch ohne Tanz sprechen läßt. verdankt sie ihn doch nur offenen oder geheimen Beziehungen zum Tanz. Schöne Hände wollen zeigen, daß sie so gut auf den Tasten tanzen können, als die Füße auf dem Boden. Die Töne selbst bestehen im Grunde nur in einem Tanze der kleinsten Körperteilchen, die dabei so zierliche Touren (Klangfiguren) bilden, als unsre größten Tanzkünstler nur immer hervorzubringen vermögen, so daß ein Tonkünstler eigentlich nur für einen Tanzmeister der Körperteile zu achten, der in ihr sonst ungeordnetes Hüpfen Regel und harmonische Ordnung bringt.

Mit der Dichtkunst sich heutzutage in Vergleich zu stellen kann der Tanzkunst nicht wohl einfallen. Abgesehen, daß sie doch wenigstens auf zwei gleichen, die Dichtkunst aber überall auf einem langen und einem kurzen Fuße einherschreitet, ist auch die Tanzkunst eine freie Kunst, die nicht nach Brote geht, sondern aus einer uninteressierten Begeisterung dafür geübt wird, was man höchstens von solchen Dichtern sagen kann, welche die eigne Begeisterung so hoch schätzen, um auch die Kosten ihrer Veröffentlichung selbst zu tragen, indeß den andern die Begeisterung als Brotbäckerin dient, und jede neue Auflage ihrer Gedichte nur ein neuer Brotschub für sie ist.

Gar wohl erkannten auch die alten Griechen, daß die Tage, die der Gottheit heilig sind, nicht würdiger gefeiert werden können, als durch "schöngeschlungne seelenvolle Tänze, die um den prangenden Altar kreisten". Im Grunde ist's heutzutage noch nicht anders; Festtag und Balltag sind eins, nur trennt man die Sache jetzt mehr: statt um den Altar, wie ehemals, zu tanzen, setzt man sich, wenn für das Wesentlichere, den Ball selbst, nicht noch nötige Vorkehrungen zu treffen sind, des Morgens eine Weile vor den Altar, und denkt dabei wenigstens andächtig an den Abend, dann Abends wird der Tanz ohne Altar ausgeführt; denn als Untersatz von Weihrauch- und Myrrhengefäßen braucht er nicht mehr dabei zu dienen, da jeder an der Feier Teilnehmende sein Parfüm bei sich führen muß, auch hat man ja an vielen Orten noch einen Platz für das Büffet im Tanzsaale zu ersparen. Die Griechen Tänze mochten wohl auch einen ganz andern Charakter tragen, als unsre jetzigen. Den Walzer kannten jene antiken Leute gar nicht, wie sie denn überhaupt sich mehr um eine Objektenwelt außer sich drehten, als um ihr eignes Ich, wie wir tun, weil sich Jeder jetzt selbst als Zentralpunkt kennt und achtet, der als solcher sich nur um sich selbst zu bewegen hat, wie's denn im Walzer nicht anders geschieht. Mir geht's freilich, wenn ich höre, daß die Griechen und besonders die Griechinnen keinen Walzer hatten, wie jenem Indianer, der sich wunderte, daß man in England leben könnte, da man ihm sagte, das Land habe keine Kokosnüsse.

Es ist nicht zu leugnen, wie überhaupt das schöne Geschlecht uns häufig an seinem Gefühl für das Schöne übertrifft, daß wir auch in der Schätzung der Tanzkunst die Segel vor ihnen streichen müssen. Es ist wahr, wir drehen uns gern auch einmal herum, aber wir jagen, wir reiten, wir fechten auch gern; dem Mädchen aber geht nichts über den Walzer, selbst nicht das neue Kleid, das sie dabei anhat, und ich bin überzeugt, daß jedes Mädchen gern den einen Fuß hergeben würde, sobald sie sich dadurch die Erlaubnis erkaufen könnte, mit dem andern noch zu walzen, da ja manche um einen Walzer übers Maß mehr noch willig hingibt, das ganze Leben, und so im eigentlichsten Sinne des Worts für ihr Leben gern walzt. Erinnere ich mich doch, in Passavant's Lebensmagnetismus gelesen zu haben, daß Mädchen, die so gelähmt waren, daß sie für gewöhnlich sich beinahe nicht rühren konnten, fast ohne müde zu werden sich drehten, wenn es zum Tanzen kam.

Wie so züchtiglich sitzt jenes Mädchen da, und scheint kaum etwas mehr zu sein, als ein kunstreicher Hebel, angebracht an den Stricknadeln, sie in Bewegung zu setzen; ihr Auge kriecht vor jedem es treffenden kühnern Blick furchtsam in sein Gehäuse zurück und streckt erst nach langer Zeit einen Blick wie ein prüfendes Fühlhorn darunter hervor, ob kein Stein des Anstoßes mehr im Wege liege; tippe mit dem kleinen Finger an sie, und sie läuft davon, als ob eine Spinne vorn darauf säße; sieh sie draußen: trippelt sie nicht, als wenn sie mit einem Ameischen spazieren ginge, und St. Andreas gelobt hätte, die Spitze des einen Füßchens nimmer den Hacken des andern sehen zu lassen. Sieh dieses mechanische Kunstwerk auf dem Balle wieder; nur der Tanz ist's, der ihm Leben, der ihm Seele einzuflößen vermag: ihr Fuß reißt sie jetzt von selbst mit fort, und fängt schon beim ersten Tone an ungeduldig nach dem Takt den Boden zu schlagen, dem mutigen Schlachtroß gleich, das beim Ertönen der Kriegsmusik die Erde stampft, unwillig über den Zügel, der es noch zurückhält. Fügsam schmiegt sie sich jetzt in den kühnsten umschlingenden Arm; alle Muskelwellen wogen stürmisch an ihr; ihr Auge glüht zündend und entzündet durch die Glut der fremden Blicke; in Wort und Blick und jeder Bewegung spricht sich's aus, daß sie sich einer höhern adlichern Sphäre angehörig fühlt. Und ist der Ball nicht eine solche? sind nicht die Titel Göttin und Engel so gemein auf dem Balle als der Titel einer Citoyenne in jeder Republik? zieht nicht Jeder und Jede den alten Adam ganz und gar aus und wandelt als neues und verklärtes Wesen im Himmel des Ballsaals? Werden nicht Alternde hier wieder jung und gleichsam aufgekocht? erblühen nicht auf mancher Wange Rosen des schönsten Karmins, schlagen nicht an jeder Dame selbst Haare und Kleider in Blumen aus, wachsen nicht der Haar- oder Lockenlosen die herrlichsten Touren und Locken, dem Wadenlosen die schönsten vollkommenen Waden an? ja, wird nicht das Unmöglichscheinende möglich? ein Fuß, wie ein Kamel, kriecht, er wolle oder nicht, durch die Nadelöhrmündung eines Puppenschuhs, eine Hummeltaille streift einen Wespenbalg über, der keifendste Mund schminkt sich mit einem Engelslächeln; steinharte Herzen, durch Tränengüsse nicht erweichbar, schmelzen sentimental von der Brühe zuckersüßer Worte gewältigt; die schwärzeste Aschenbrödel brüstet sich eine weißgewaschene Prinzessin; kleidermachende Jünglinge entwickeln die sonst ewig zusammengefalteten Beine; der Pharmazeut bietet statt Latwergen neben süßen Worten und Blicken noch süßere Zuckerplätzchen. Wer hält das für unser gewöhnliches irdisches Leben!

Es ist hiernach gar nicht zu verwundern, warum für viele Schönen der Sommer die traurigste Jahreszeit ist die es gibt, weil er den Bällen gewöhnlich ein Ende macht; zwar hat man die Freuden der Natur; allein wie wenig Ersatz vermögen diese zu gewähren. Der Sonnenaufgang, ja, er mag ganz herrlich sein; aber die Sonne paßt es allemal ab, daß sie noch früher aufsteht als wir selbst, so daß sie zwar bei der Toilette unsrer Damen durchs Fenster zusieht, umgekehrt aber sich nicht von diesen bei ihrer Toilette zusehen läßt; eben so maliciös verfährt sie beim Untergange; sie nimmt gewiß jedesmal die Zeit dazu wahr, wo die spazierengehenden Damen gerade in einem eifrigen Gespräch über einen Hut, Schuh oder ein andres Stück der menschlichen Hülse begriffen sind, so daß dieselben nichts davon gewahr werden. So wachsen zwar auch recht schöne Blumen im Sommer, allein gerade auf solchen Stellen, wo meist nur Schafe und Kühe hinkommen, dagegen auf den Spaziergängen der Menschen Wegstaub den Blütenstaub reichlich ersetzt. Was hat man also am Ende im ganzen Sommer, das uns das Wintervergnügen des Tanzes ersetzen könnte; der Sommer ist höchstens als ein schwacher Versuch der Natur zu betrachten, uns für die Entbehrung des Tanzes in einer gewissen Zeit, in der wir neue Kräfte zum Wintertanze sammeln sollen, etwas zu entschädigen, und bloß deshalb mag auch die Sonne so heiß im Sommer scheinen, weil die menschliche Natur eigentlich auf eine tägliche Schweißausleerung durch den Tanz angewiesen ist, diese aber im Sommer, wo der Mensch auszuruhen hat, unterbrochen werden würde, wenn nicht die Sonne sich hier als Diaphoreticum ins Mittel schlüge. Gewiß ist auch die eigentliche Bedeutung des Spruchs: "Im Schweiße deines Angesichts sollst du dein Brot essen," keine andre, als: du sollst nicht eher essen, als bis du dich in Schweiß getanzt hast.

Wollte man selbst gegen alle Vorteile der Bälle stockblind sein, so würde man doch notwendig zugeben müssen, daß Bälle die Arbeitsamkeit der jungen Mädchen auf das vorteilhafteste befördern. Manche, die sonst keine Nadel anrühren und die Hände müßig in den Schoß legen würde, wird durch den Ball zum angestrengtesten Kunstfleiße aufgeregt und ihre Finger fliegen vor dem Balle eben so geschwind, als ihre Füße auf demselben. Jedem Mädchen gibt ein Ball acht Tage vorher und dann geistig noch acht Tage nachher zu tun, so daß die ganze Zwischenzeit von einem Balle zum andern entweder nur eine Aussaat für die Ernte des Ballabends oder ein Nachessen von den Früchten desselben ist, die sie in der Nacherinnerung und noch mehr in der Nachrede genießt.

Man denke Sich einen Maler, der sich schon wochenlang mit der Idee zur Ausführung eines Gemäldes herumgetragen hat, man denke ihn, wie er die beste Leinwand, die glänzendsten Farben in allen Läden aufzutreiben sucht, wie er, fast Essen und Trinken vergessend, von seiner Staffelei nicht weicht noch wankt, einzig und allein mit Ausführung seines Gemäldes beschäftigt, das ihm am Tage der Ausstellung Ruhm erwerben soll, wie er hundertmal übermalt und retouchiert, indem er das Bild, das er im Geiste trägt, nicht so ganz, wie er möchte, anschaulich darzustellen vermag, wie er weiß, daß seine Idee göttlich ist, und wie er, wenn er nun zuletzt alles geendet hat, das feste Vertrauen hegt, jede werde bei den übrigen Gemälden vorübergehn, nur bei dem seinen stehen bleiben. Kann man sich einen solchen Maler lebhaft vorstellen, nun so setze man statt des Malers ein junges Mädchen, statt der Staffelei den Spiegel, statt des Pinsels Nadel und Schere, statt Leinwand und Farben Seidenzeug und Bänder, statt des Gedankens zum Gemälde die beste Idee, die ein Mädchen von ihren Reizen nur immer haben kann, und man braucht nichts mehr zum Bilde eines Mädchens, das sich auf einen Weihnachts- oder andern großen Ball zurichtet.
