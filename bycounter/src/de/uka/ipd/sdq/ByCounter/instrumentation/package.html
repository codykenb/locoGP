     Provides counting instrumentation for ByCounter.
     <p>
     From a user perspective, the class {@link de.uka.ipd.sdq.ByCounter.instrumentation.InstrumentationParameters}
     is of main interest. It is used by ByCounter to specify how to instrument 
     Java classes and decides what results are produced by ByCounter and how 
     they can be retrieved.
     Other classes are used internally by ByCounter.
